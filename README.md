# FoodScanner

## Application by Harleen Chaudhary and Zhe Tu

This is a user friendly application built with react-native over the course of 14 days which allows users to scan barcodes, take pictures, enter names of food items and get the nutrition facts. The app uses the FDA API to get the nutrition values of the food. 

The sprints for this project are under the projects section of this repository.
